# Duolingo-Report
Technical Report on Duo-lingo and its Services (Software Engineering Principles)


Description:
This case study is based on Duolingo, a rapidly growing online
language-learning platform. The study specifies the system's development and
maintenance from a software engineering standpoint, focusing on its
functionalities and features that changed the field of its application domain,
as well as its limitations in functionality and qualities. We also conclude with
the ethical concerns that have arisen throughout its software lifecycle, as well
as a brief discussion of possible future trends and system improvements that
the platform could incorporate in future releases.

BEHIND THE SCENES :
  Given as a coursework assigment to target a propietary system aimed at end users and form an techinical report from an software developer perspective , I choose Duolingo as I was familiarised with their functinalities and features. I personally used the app to learn Espanol during the COVID and I felt it was a perfect tribute in writing about their services. The report helped me understand how startups cope up with data and large consumer base, I was introduced to Agile Development and the ethical concerns with any app (the GRAY lines) and finally the revenue stream of the app and how they managed to stick to their core values : Providing free education.Though Duolingo has gone through several changes from its birth, it has stayed true to its users ,resulting in a massive userbase of  49.2 million MAU (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo).
