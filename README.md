# Duolingo-Report
Technical Report on Duo-lingo and its Services (Software Engineering Principles)


Description:
This case study is based on Duolingo, a rapidly growing online
language-learning platform. The study specifies the system's development and
maintenance from a software engineering standpoint, focusing on its
functionalities and features that changed the field of its application domain,
as well as its limitations in functionality and qualities. We also conclude with
the ethical concerns that have arisen throughout its software lifecycle, as well
as a brief discussion of possible future trends and system improvements that
the platform could incorporate in future releases.

BEHIND THE SCENES :
  I chose Duolingo for my coursework assignment since I was already familiar with its operations and features. The task was to target a proprietary system geared at end users and create a technical report from a software development perspective. During the COVID, I personally utilised the app to learn Spanish, and I thought it was the ideal way to honour their services by writing about them. I learned about Agile Development, the ethical issues with any app (the GRAY lines), the revenue stream of the app, and how the company was able to maintain its commitment to its basic values—providing free education. Despite numerous changes since its inception, Duolingo has remained committed to its consumers, resulting in a sizable user base of  49.2 million MAU.
